# PushWorld PLR Training with Benchmark Puzzles Configuration
# 
# This config uses a FIXED BENCHMARK of puzzles instead of random generation.
# PLR prioritizes which puzzles to train on based on learning signal.

defaults:
  - learning/ppo
  - ued/plr
  - misc/misc
  - eval/pushworld
  - _self_

# === BENCHMARK CONFIG ===
# Option 1: Load by name (auto-downloads from HuggingFace if needed)
# Available names: 'level0_transformed_all', 'level0_transformed_base', 'level0_mini'
benchmark_name: level0_transformed_all

# Option 2: Load from explicit path (uncomment to use instead)
# benchmark_path: /path/to/your/benchmark.pkl
benchmark_path: null

# === ENVIRONMENT CONFIG ===
grid_size: 10
penalize_time: true
reward_shaping: false
max_steps_in_episode: 100

# === Override PLR settings for benchmark mode ===
# Since we have a fixed set of puzzles, we don't need minimum_fill_ratio
# The buffer is pre-filled with all training puzzles at startup
replay_prob: 1.0  # Always replay (no DR since we don't generate new levels)
minimum_fill_ratio: 0.0  # Buffer is pre-filled

# === Run name ===
run_name: pushworld_plr_benchmark
